# TODO CHALLENGE 1: Create a new main/game python file and then create a go fish/game class
# The constructor of the class should include
    # a deck of cards object
    # a list to store players
    # a property that tracks if the game is still being played
# HINT: Donâ€™t forget to import any necessary files/classes at the top!
